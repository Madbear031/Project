 ## 1. Introduction
Main purpose of that document is description of the «График нарядов» desktop application test plan. That information made to testing team which going to test application for compliance.
 ## 2. Test object
Test object includes functional requirements, convenience and ease of use. The quality attributes:
1.	functionality;
2.	simplicity of use;
 ## 3. Ricks
Device must have keybord, mouse(or touchpad), .NET 4.7.2 for correct application operation.
 ## 4. Test aspects
During the testing process it`s expected to check the compliance of the requirements on the basis of which it was designed and realised. Compliance requirements:

2.	 Adding data on a soldier or unit in the database in 3 clicks.
 ## 5. Test approaches
Manual testing must be used to check all test aspects.
 ## 6. Conclusions
This test plan allows you to test the main functionality of the application. Successful completion of all tests does not guarantee full functionality on all platforms and architectures, however, allows you to believe that this software is working correctly.
